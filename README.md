Das Aktienregister.

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/377697aa-3cb5-4458-9e05-321115975157/403062/badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/vbnet/daeg)

CapTable
===========================
This app provides an easy to user interface to have a simple CapTable (no options, ESOP etc for now). Means enter company data, enter shareholders, have transactions for shareholders, print CapTable, edit company core data, enter capital increases. Supports a single asset type for now (named/registered share OR bearer share).

GAFI Standards
===========================
This application is especially made to fullfil the new [GAFI Standard](http://www.fatf-gafi.org/) for money laundering in Switzerland. Applies only to companies if they choose their companies location defined in Switzerland.
